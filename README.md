# Federal-Reserve-Sentiment-Index
Sentiment index with the goal of quantifying forward guidance

This repo will host the data for a federal reserve sentiment index. The index is made up of individual speeches from FOMC governors which get a rank from 1 to -1, 1 being a hawkish stance, and -1 being a dovish stance, based on an LLM strategy. The 12 month moving average is then taken to flatten out the volatility and show an underlying trend. This trend tends to lead the effective federal funds rate and other treasury yields.
